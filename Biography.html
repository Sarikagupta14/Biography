            <p style="Font-size:25px;">INTRODUCTION</p>
        </b>

    <p>Hey,I am sarika.
        I Worked as Engineer-1 in the field of production management for chemical industry.
        I have an experience of 1.3 years in supporting and maintaining the lifecycle
        process of chemical manufacturing and supply  chain managemet.
        I am a hardworking professional and looking for an opportunities 
        <b>to take up engineering roles in the Software development industry.</b>
        <br>
        
        <p>So,from here I want to share a short experience of mine because I feel,
            most of the people are struggling through the same but never take their steps
            forward because of fear of losing.But,I beleive that-
            <br>"You will never fail,Either you will win or learn"<br>
        </p>
        <p>Everyone have their dreams like becoming Doctor, Engineer,IAS officer etc.
            I grown up with always having dream of being Doctor but because of some circumstances
        I was not able to join it and then chosen the direction of graduation in B.H.U.
        Those 3 years were really tough because i was doing the thing i never wanted to!!
        Then I got placed and spent more than 1 year there and while working I was trying to explore
        new things too and slowly developed my interest in Software development field. I started learning
        <strong>Python</strong>-"My first Programming language" and seriously it was happening after years tht I was completey
        in into the work I was doing but It was really tough decision for me to left job and start from zero in 
        different field.
        I knew struggle will be there and path is going to be so tough but i didn't wanted to compromise with my dreams 
        because of only fear that was pulling me back friom inside.
        One evening when I was scrolling the feeds on linkdln I saw one line that was -
        <strong>"YOU CAN LIVE WITH FAILURE BUT SHOULD NOT LIVE WITH REGRET."</strong>
        That evening I decided to give a chance to me for my happiness,for my dreams!!
        I resigned from job and almost 3 months has been done I am trying my best every second,every minute
        and every single day and Rest...
        JUST HOPING FOR THE BEST!!
